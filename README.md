# ENCORE
The periphery and the core properties explain the omnigenic model in the human interactome



ENCORE.ENCORE.Pattern_detection is used to find the peripheral and core properties of a disease neighborhood in the Human Interactome.
We develop pEriphery aNd COre pRopErties (ENCORE) model to disclose component property of a disease neighborhood. 
ENCORE reveal that highly perturbed genes connect into disease-specific cores that drive complex pathological processes, while genes in peripheries are more likely to be shared across diseases.
ENCORE inspires a deeper understanding of interconnectivity of phenotypically related genes, revealing the characteristics of core and periphery.
